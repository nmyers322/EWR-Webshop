These pages, starting at index.php, make up the E.W.R. webstore. The "shop" page is a fully functional shopping cart integrated with PayPal. The orders get saved into a MySQL database and can be accessed and manipulated using the "admin" back-end page. 

I wrote all of these pages (except where noted in code) entirely in Notepad between January 2009 and March 2013. Several updates were made over these years and the code isn't really organized well. I started this project before going back to college and it shows. I didn't follow standard practices of documentation, indenting, or naming conventions. I have a lot of repeated code. I didn't use variables when I should have. I could have easily made this a shopping cart app that other people could use, but I was only interested in creating it just for a single use. I'm now distributing it in case anyone else out there wants to try out their own custom shopping cart with PHP/MySQL and PayPal. To use this software, you'll have to open the CREATE_EWR_DATABASE.txt and run those queries in PHPMyAdmin or whatever your desired interface is. Then you'll have to sift through the code and change contact information, images, etc. to fit your own needs. To enter the admin section, go to http://yoursite.com/?page=admin, or you can look for the small "invisible" square on the right border of the page and click on that. To enter, you'll have to create a user in your MySQL table "users" called "admin" and give it an MD5 password and admin level of "2". I had plans to add other users that could perform less priviledged actions but it never happened, so your user table will only have one entry (unless you add on to it of course). I hope this project helps somebody in some way! All code is released in the GNU GPL and was written by me (Nathanial Myers) unless noted in code. The included pictures were designed by me in GIMP using Google images or were photographed by me.
